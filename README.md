# Ufo Hunter

A short kinda demo game for the gameboy. You control a plane and shoot down ufos. 
This is my first video game so any tip or advice for game boy development or game development in general is welcome.

Includes 3 levels. I will include a new enemy for the third level and a boss.

### Controls

Directional Pad - Move

Btn A - Shoot

Start - Pause

Select - Change the speed of the ufos (Makes the game harder or easier)
